# Portfolio

A modern and responsive Portfolio application built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.
This is my personal portfolio website, carefully designed with smooth animations and a clean UI. While some animations are more prominent on desktop and laptop screens, I have optimized the layout and experience to look great on mobile devices as well. The result is a visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and fast-loading portfolio site that works across all screen sizes.
